📝 FlowDo – MERN Stack To-Do App

FlowDo is a simple yet powerful task management app built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
It helps users organize their daily tasks efficiently with a clean and intuitive interface.

This project was built as part of my MERN learning journey — focusing on user authentication, CRUD operations, and a responsive UI.

🚀 Features

🔐 User Authentication – Secure login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Token).
